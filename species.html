                <h1>Trout</h1>
                <p>Trout are the most common fish that you will find off the coast of Nags Head, NC. They tend to travel in schools and are good eating. For live baits, trout will eat small croaker and shiners. If you plan to use artificials, you'll have the best luck with swim baits, but rooster tails and cranks that resemble baitfish will get the job done. You can find trout within 10 miles out of the sound and in grass flats.</p>

                <h1>Red Drum</h1>
                <p>Red drum or 'reds' are best known for the black spot on their tails. Reds are a great sport fish as they put up a hearty fight, and are a moderate flavored tasting fish. You will usually find them in groups of 1-3 in shallower waters. Gold spoons work best for catching some reds, but they will also eat small baitfish.</p>

                <h1>Spanish Mackerel</h1>
                <p>Spanish mackerel are a great sport and eating fish. They fight vigorously when hooked and are sure to put up a good fight. Mackerel travel in schools and you are most likely to find them trolling off the coastline with a baitfish lure. You can also catch Spanish off piers and while anchored up. Your best bet when doing this is using a wooden plug with a fast retrieval.</p>

                <h1>Sheepshead</h1>
                <p>Sheepshead are another amazing sport and eating fish. Thier tough skin and sharp teeth means you need a heavier rig and sharp hooks. Because thier diet consists of crustaceans, you'll want to use fiddler craps, sand fleas, or other small bait fish. Sheepshead hang out around structures like pilings and you'll need to go all the way to the bottom if you want to catch these fighters.</p>
